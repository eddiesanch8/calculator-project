console.log(`connected!`)


//1.  I need a way to get a user's input. 
//2.  I need to validate the input, so they must only be numbers. 


//3. Once the input is captured, I need a way to make calculations
//4. Maybe the function run depends on the button clicked? Or the index?

//5. Once the calculation is created, I need to display the calculation
